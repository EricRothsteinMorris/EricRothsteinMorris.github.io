Hi! My name is Eric Rothstein-Morris. I'm a fourth year Information Systems Technology and Design ([ISTD](http://istd.sutd.edu.sg)) PhD student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design ([SUTD](http://www.sutd.edu.sg)), under supervision of Assistant Professor [Sudipta Chattopadhyay](https://sudiptac.bitbucket.io/). I'm currently researching how to close timing and memory side-channels in software that does not necessarily follow constant-time programming guidelines.

Before coming to SUTD, I was a research assistant working with the [IT-security group](https://web.sec.uni-passau.de/) of the University of Passau. I completed my Masters in Engineering at the [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en) in 2011, and I have been exploring the world of research and academia since then.

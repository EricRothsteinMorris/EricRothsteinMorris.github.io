## Ubuntu freshly installed


## Installing
First, we install gem5 by going to https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building
and follow Setup on Ubuntu 20.04. Do note that you have to CLONE and BUILD gem5 using the debug variant
DO ENABLE BRANCH PREDICTION ON THE SIMPLE CPU by going

Part 2: Adding Branch Predictor Support to Timing Simple CPU:
By default, GEM5 TimingSimpleCPU does not have the BranchPredictor Support. You need to
add the support of your Predictor. Below are the steps of adding the BranchPrediction support
to Timing Simple CPU:
$ce6304:> cd $gem5/src/cpu/simple
Edit the file named “BaseSimpleCPU.py” and at the bottom you should find the line:
branchPred = Param.BranchPredictor(NULL, "Branch Predictor")
Change the “NULL” to your predictor of choice each time and then compile gem5.
Change it to
branchPred = Param.BranchPredictor(TournamentBP(numThreads = Parent.numThreads), "Branch Predictor")

                                                  //install ninja by configure.py and the copy it to somewhere in your path

LLVM can be downloaded from the sources

install cmake
install clang
install python3-pip (pip3)
install pandas using pip3
clone and install llvm using the To download section below.
build LLVM using
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<Directory> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host ../llvm (use LLVM_CTP for the directory hehe)
cmake --build . -- -j7 (Installation comes later!)
paste the CTP folder to the ./lib/Transforms
modify the CMakeLists.txt in Transforms
run this again.
cmake --build . -- -j7
cmake --build . --target install  

//Maybe you want it with ninja?
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host ../llvm

### To download:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd <llvm-project-directory>  
git checkout release/11.x
mkdir <build-directory>
cd <build-directory>
#cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DLLVM_HELLONEWPM_LINK_INTO_TOOLS=ON ../llvm
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      #-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang
      #-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
      #-DLLVM_USE_NEWPM=ON\
      -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86\
      #-DLLVM_<TOOL_NAME>_LINK_INTO_TOOLS=ON \ #Maybe this is what put things inside of Opt, develop tool in `tools/`
      #-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation-directory>
      ../llvm
cmake --build . -- -j7

(THE FOLLOWING DOES NOT compile clang or clang++, just LLVM)
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86\
      ../llvm

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_USE_NEWPM=ON -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host ../llvm
cmake --build . -- -j7

//THIS IS THE ONE THAT WE NEED TO RUN TO COMPILE CLANG TOO
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host ../llvm
cmake --build . -- -j7

Binaries should be in `<build-directory>/bin`

```
### To Check:
```shell
make check-cxx
make check-clang
```

### To install:
```shell
cmake --build . --target install   
```
Finally, define the `$LLVM_DIR` variable
```shell
export LLVM_DIR=<installation-directory>
```
This should install a version of LLVM in your `<installation-directory>`.

## To test
To run `clang` with the newly built libraries, you need to add additional parameters when compiling
```shell
$LLVM_DIR/bin/clang -I/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/<MacOSX-Version>.sdk/usr/include <hello-world>.c

```
## Generate low-level and bytecode files
**TODO**

## Hello World pass

I refused to make a legacy pass, which has a couple of complications:
  * We have to include them in the pipeline.
  * We need to use the legacy PassManager pipeline.
  * To register a pass with the new PM, you need to add it to the `PassRegistry.def` file.


LLVM comes already with a `Hello World` pass in `<llvm-project>/llvm/lib/Transforms/Hello/`. When built, this pass creates a dylib in
`<build-folder>/lib/LLVMHello.dylib`. This pass is registered with the _legacy_ pass manager. Unfortunately, I did not find any way to register passes with the new pass manager, so we have to follow [llvm-tutor](https://github.com/banach-space/llvm-tutor) in creating passes that register both with the legacy and with the new pass manager.

We are going to be adding passes to the Transform directory. That way, they are included in `opt` thanks to the legacy pass manager. To add it, use the following
```make
add_llvm_pass_plugin(HelloNewPMPass
  HelloNewPM.cpp  
  DEPENDS
  intrinsics_gen
)
```
ignore
```make
add_llvm_library( libHelloNewPM MODULE BUILDTREE_ONLY
 HelloNewPM.cpp

  DEPENDS
  intrinsics_gen
  PLUGIN_TOOL
  opt
  )
```

To invoke this pass, we use `opt` in `$LLVM_DIR/bin/`
```shell
 $LLVM_DIR/bin/opt -load lib/LLVMHello.dylib -hello -disable-output <ll-file>.ll
```
**With the new pass manager, the pass should already be inside of `opt`**
To invoke our pass with the **new** pass manager, we have to provide the sequence of passes
```shell
#$LLVM_DIR/bin/opt -load-pass-plugin=<> -passes="<pass-name[,pass-name]>" <ll-file>.ll #Does not seem to find passes in Mac
```

## A second Hello World Pass
We want to register our own plugin, called `Cookies`. To do so, we copy the `Hello World` plugin, modify the appropriate `CMake` files, and run from `<build-directory>`
```shell
cmake --build lib/Transforms/Cookies
```
!! I put `add_external_project` in the CMake file
I really recommend you follow this tutorial, parts [I](https://medium.com/@mshockwave/writing-llvm-pass-in-2018-part-i-531c700e85eb) and [II](https://medium.com/@mshockwave/writing-llvm-pass-in-2018-part-ii-640f680978ec).

[//]: # ( A more interesting example can be found in `<llvm-project>/llvm/examples/Bye`. It also generates a dylib.)
### A Duplicating BB plugin


### To keep in mind


The print method must be implemented by “analyses” in order to print a human readable version of the analysis results. This is useful for debugging an analysis itself, as well as for other people to figure out how an analysis works. Use the opt -analyze argument to invoke this method.

By using the –debug-pass=Structure option, for example, we can see how our Hello World pass interacts with other passes. Lets try it out with the gvn and licm passes:

We can link passes now! YAY! put them all in the same library
```shell
./bin/opt -load lib/LLVM-Tutor.dylib -legacy-duplicate-bb < input_for_duplicate_bb.ll  > output_for_duplicate_bb.bc

./bin/llvm-dis output_for_duplicate_bb.bc -o output_for_duplicate_bb.ll
```
Combined
```shell
./bin/opt -load lib/LLVM-CTP.dylib --legacy-ctp-merge-branches /Users/EGRM/Desktop/CTPExamples/ToBalance_unsafe.ll | ./bin/llvm-dis -o Pass_ToBalance_unsafe.ll
```

### Spectre examples also work to test for spectre.

### Examples (for EGRM)
In llvm <build> folder.
```shell
./bin/clang -S -o0 -emit-llvm -I /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include -o /Users/EGRM/Desktop/CTPExamples/ConstantTimeComparison_unsafe.ll /Users/EGRM/Desktop/CTPExamples/ConstantTimeComparison_unsafe.c
```

###Putting everything back together
```shell
./bin/clang -S -emit-llvm -I /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include -O0 -o /Users/EGRM/Desktop/CTPExamples/Print_unsafe.ll /Users/EGRM/Desktop/CTPExamples/Print_unsafe.c

./bin/opt -load lib/LLVM-CTP.dylib --legacy-ctp-merge-branches /Users/EGRM/Desktop/CTPExamples/Print_unsafe.ll | ./bin/llvm-dis -o Pass_Print_unsafe.ll

llc -filetype=obj -O0 -o Pass_Print_unsafe.o Pass_Print_unsafe.ll
clang -o Pass_Print_unsafe Pass_Print_unsafe.o            
./Pass_Print_unsafe
```


./bin/opt -load lib/LLVM-CTP.dylib -mergereturn -mem2reg -legacy-ctp-merge-branches /Users/EGRM/Desktop/CTPExamples/ToBalance_unsafe_cheat.ll | ./bin/llvm-dis -o Pass_ToBalance_unsafe_cheat.ll

Interesting instruction:
```
CastInst *AllocaInsertionPoint = new BitCastInst(
    Constant::getNullValue(Type::getInt32Ty(F.getContext())),
    Type::getInt32Ty(F.getContext()), "reg2mem alloca point", &*I);
```
the LLVM loop unroll is not the transformation we want. In pseudocode, LLVM unroll is
e^[0..n] -> (e;...;e)^[0..n/k] where k is the number of es in e;...;e, while the
unfold we want is e^[0..n] -> (e +[0..n] 1);...;(e +[0..n] 1)
